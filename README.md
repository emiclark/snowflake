# snowflake

This is an app that I made around New Years that has some of my favorite things.
It opens with a simple chained animation and when finished, plays Ed Sheeran's, Shape Of You music while simulating snowflakes falling over a winter scene.

1. The snowflakes are created using the particle emitter and the QuartzCore framework. 
2. The app can play the music while in background mode.
